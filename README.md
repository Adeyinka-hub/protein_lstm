Protein sequence Classification using RNNs and CNNs (1D) 

Currently CNNS(1D) are prvoing a lot better than RNNS for protein seq classifications with 78% accuracy. CNNs still need to converge which suggests more training and probably deeper models.

LSTMs couldn't exceed a validation accuracy more than 20%.

LSTM Model probably needed n-grams or a bi-directional model.
